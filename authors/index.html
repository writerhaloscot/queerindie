                                <p class="author-blurb">TT Banks enjoys spending time with her wife and furry family - not writing this bio - the fact is, she&rsquo;d rather be doing anything other than writing in the 3rd person about herself. She writes books - this shouldn&rsquo;t come as a surprise to you - you&rsquo;re currently reading her author bio - so there&rsquo;s that. She writes funny, quirky - sometimes nerve-racking - always sexy lesbian fiction novels. She taught middle school math for one terrifying year and has since been a successful entrepreneur. She needed an outlet for her creative, goofy, slightly dark side - and that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;ll find in her books.<br /><a class="button" href="https://www.amazon.com/TT-Banks/e/B07VGBGFFD" target="_blank">TT Banks</a></p>
