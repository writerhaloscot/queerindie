                                <p class="author-blurb">TT Banks would rather be doing anything other than writing in the 3rd person about herself. She writes books - this shouldn&rsquo;t come as a surprise to you - you&rsquo;re currently reading her author bio! She writes funny, quirky - sometimes nerve-racking - always sexy - lesbian fiction novels. She taught middle school math for one terrifying year and has since been a successful entrepreneur. She needed an outlet for her creative, goofy, slightly dark side - and that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;ll find in her books.

                                    Hi there! I&rsquo;m Evan, Evan Knapp. I came to writing pretty much the way most authors do. I flunked out/dropped out of high school, then ran away from home to live on the streets of Portland, Oregon in the early &rsquo;80s. I panhandled, I was an underage club-kid, dabbled in prostitution, told ridiculous bedtime stories to my friends, all while training to be a classical ballet dancer. Then, I started getting dance jobs and had a 30-year career in the performing arts. I was also a teacher, choreographer, director and producer. I retired, then went to college - studying performing arts - to get that piece of paper that said I was qualified to do what I&rsquo;d been doing my whole life, because I thought I was just a dumb dancer and I needed to prove to myself I wasn’t. I graduated Magna Cum Laude. During my senior year (at age 40-something) I met a professor, Christian De Matteo (<a href="https://www.tellworthy.com/" target="_blank" class="link">Tellworthy.com</a>) who&rsquo;s infectious love of the written word, in all its forms, somehow smeared off onto me, and, I inadvertently wrote a book. It feels akin to choreographing with words. Right! My book. My book is a short-form bildungsroman memoir titled, WHERE THERE iS MOVEMENT.
